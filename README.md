# lfs-simphys-limiter

Limits the max amount of LFS and simphys a player can have out at once.

Currently, restriction addons like URS and WUMA allow you to only limit per vehicle rather than having a global LFS / simpfhys limit.
Eg. you want people only be able to spawn 2 simphys, with restriction addons this would be impossible as you can only restrict on class basis.
So you'd end up with every car having a limit of 2 which would allow players to spawn 3x2 different cars.

This addon aims to add a more global like limit for LFS and Simpfhys.
