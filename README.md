# LFS & Simfphys Limiter

Limits the max amount of LFS and Simfphys a player can have out at once.

Currently, restriction addons like URS and WUMA allow you to only limit per vehicle rather than having a global LFS / Simfphys limit.
I.e. you want people only be able to spawn two Simfphys, with restriction addons this would be impossible as you can only restrict on class basis.
So, you'd end up with every vehicle having a limit of two which would allow players to spawn 3x2 different vehicle.
